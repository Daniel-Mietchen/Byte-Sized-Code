**Why do you want the topic?**  
Is it something you feel difficult to understand?  
Are you unable to find proper documentation for the requested topic?  
[e.g. Regular Expressions are a complex topic and it is difficult for me to understand the official documentation for it.]

**What do you want?**  
Describe what a notebook on the given topic should contain.  
[e.g. It should contain the basics of Regular Expression and also provide specific examples of how we can use complex expressions or things such as backreferencing and capturing groups.]

**How will it help others?**  
Describe how a notebook on the given topic will be beneficial for the community at large.  
[e.g. Regular Expressions are pretty much needed by most people who work with data and I think a large number of people will benefit if a notebook with clear examples is made available on the topic.]
